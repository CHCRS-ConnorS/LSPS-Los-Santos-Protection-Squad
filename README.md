LOS SANTOS PROTECTION SQUAD

============= How to INSTALL ! =============
1. Copy the files contained in the "Drop these files to the root of GTA V" in "Files".
2. Paste them into the root of your GTA V (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V for Steam users)
3. Read the ProtectionSquad.ini file if you want to see what options it provides, but if you don't, LSPS will run fine as it is.

============= ELS USERS ! =============
Fellow ELS users, LSPS is totally compatible with els, but unfortunately, I am not able to mute the sirens on ELS-ready vehicles, 
so you'll have to drive the convoy with full tone sirens if you do play with ELS enabled, which can be a bit annoying.

============= How to PLAY ! =============
The escort missions are loaded like any other callout and managed by LSPDFR. They can be triggered only when on-duty. 
/!/ Callouts can be activated by either using LSPDFRs menu, waiting or using Callout Manager, when on-duty with LSPDFR
I personally recommend not to spawn any bodyguard(s) before or in the mission to avoid relationship conflicts, 
- as your bodyguards and the guards spawned by LSPS will probably end up fighting each other.

List of callouts dispatched by LSPS : 
	- Protection : Arcadius Center to Golf Club
	- Protection : Kortz Center to Galileo Observatory
	- Protection : Los Santos Airport to Arcadius Center
	- Protection : Los Santos Airport to Galileo Observatory
	- Protection : Los Santos Airport to NOOSE HQ
	- Protection : Los Santos Airport to Union Depository
	- Protection : Maze Bank to NOOSE Headquarters
	- Protection : Maze Bank to Los Santos Airport
	- Protection : Union Depository to Los Santos Golf Club
	- Protection : NOOSE HQ to Maze Bank
	- Protection : Kortz Center to Maze Bank
	- Protection : Galileo Observatory to Richards Majestic
	- Prisoner Transfer : Vespucci Police Station - Bolingbroke Penitentiary
	- Ambulance Escort : Bolingbroke Penitentiary - Davis Hospital

Once you've accepted the callout (by pressing Y), follow the instructions displayed. 
You can modify the vehicles of the convoy, as well as use other options, in an in-game menu displayed before the mission starts.
Everything just works.

///!///============= About Stuck Vehicles =============///!///
Los Santos Protection Squad relies on Rockstar's pathing system, which is not always very good. On some cases, a vehicle of the convoy may be stuck. 
But guess what, using some random magic, you can press a combination of keys to get the convoy moving again !
							
					Press : > SHIFT + Y < to teleport the vehicles on the road again.
				
============= About Risk Levels =============
The risk level is displayed on the top left corner of your screen. By default, it is "medium", but when you drive through dangerous neighbourhoods, it increases to "high".
A high risk level means a higher chance to get attacked in those dangerous districts of LS. 
I'd recommend to drive very fast if you see the risk level is high.
When you manage to reach a less dangerous neighborhood (eg. from Strawberry to Pillbox Hill), the risk level will lower to medium again, but that does not mean you'll not get attacked there !

Thank you for reading the instructions.
